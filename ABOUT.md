First of all, I was trying my best to create this application, but I know I can do much better. 
There are several issues I could not figured out. That is why I decided to use methods and
technologies I used. I was trying to also complete all bonuses, but for example I stil struggle
with coding culture a bit. I stil dont know much about angular, becouse there is so much to learn,
but I think I am getting used to it and I am determined to learn and study hard this Framework if
you decide to hire me as UI Trainee.
